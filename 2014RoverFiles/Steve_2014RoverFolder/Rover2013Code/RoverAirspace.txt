Reiterated Prompt from URC 2013 Rules:
1.b.ii. Any airborne vehicles must meet any and all FAA (United States Federal Aviation Authority) guidelines that apply to operating unmanned aircraft in a remote area. It will be the responsibility of each team to research any such FAA requirements and provide documentation to the judges prior to April 29, 2013.

Synopsis
	For the 2013 URC, the BYU Mars Rover Team will field UAVs in the 1.0 kg to 2.0 kg weight range. So long as these vehicles are not operated for profit or other commercial use, the activity is legal. Until the FAA releases a complete set of rules, there are no hard-fast regulations; only guidelines drawn in AC 91-57 on Model Aircraft Operation from the 1980's. The more recent NPRM requested an end to all commercial activities until rules can be made, hence the reason we cannot preform for profit. Otherwise, the issue is left open. On the state-law level, Utah has not drawn any regulations governing the use of UAVs.
	
	We have preformed with a vehicle in this class before, and have designed a new vehicle for the competiton with the intent to operate safely and efficiently in the varied tasks to be completed.
