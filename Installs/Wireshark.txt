Wireshark is the program that allows us to monitor and check the packets that the Rover Comms system pushes around. Critical to see if the UDP packets are working.
Wireshark is also very useful for general-purpose network troubleshooting. Discovering the IP Address for the Ubiquity RocketM2 transceivers, for example.
