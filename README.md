Prime Resources
============

The core, essential definitions of all BYU Mars Rover Systems and Components.
This folder contains items such as the 2015 Contest Rules, Master Diagrams, and the RoverLink protocol master definitions.

This folder may also server as a starting point for any future repository files, for example: We don't have a Repo for any circuit board schematics or layouts. We may have any such artwork reside in its respective repo, like having the main controller circuit schematic and layout living in the MasterControlBoard repo, but if we start to generate lots of schematics for lots of boards, we may as well create a new repo called "CircuitBoards" or "BoardArtwork" or something like that. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we may a repo for every single board we make. Regardless, it may be wise to start my such stems in the Prime-Resources folder here and then fully-promote to repo later.
